# Introduction

This readme explains how to run the sample in Docker.

Doing so, you do not need to have ODM installed. Instead we are relying on the [ODM for developers](https://github.com/DecisionsDev/odm-for-developers) container image.

# Starting the ODM Container

Start the ODM container:
```bash
docker-compose up odm &
```

# Running the sample

Follow the instructions in [README](README.md)

# Stopping the ODM Container

```bash
docker-compose down
```
